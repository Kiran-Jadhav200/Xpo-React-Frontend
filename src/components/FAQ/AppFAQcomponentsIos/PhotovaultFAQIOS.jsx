			answer:
				"Xproguard Photo Vault encrypts and hides your photos and videos, making them nearly impossible to access without your private PIN or fingerprint. No more worrying about people accessing your pictures or videos; \n\nWhat's more, our app has no storage limitations, meaning you can store as many images and videos as you wish. And all your files are stored locally, so there's no need to worry about cloud storage risks. \n\nWe also include a handy backup feature to keep your media safe in the event that something happens to your device. You can even access backup files from anywhere, so you never miss out on an important memory.",
		},
		{
			question: "  Why does this app use only local storage backup?",
			answer:

		},
		{
			question: "What is the use of the Secret Door feature?",
